== Project: Health Book

---
== Introduction

My team comprises of 5 members of different roles: Project Manager, Development Lead, Quality Assurance Lead, User Interface Lead and Subject Matter Expert and together, we created our unique version of a Health Book application.
The purpose of this portfolio is to document my contributions towards the Health Book and showcase the implementation of my features, the codes I have written and the changes I have made to the User and Developer Guides.

== Overview

Health Book is an application written in Java catered to *healthcare professionals* in _retrieving patientsâ€™ personal information and health-related information all in one place_. Command Line Interface (CLI) is utilized mainly for user input, while Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used mainly to display the output. Combining these 2 interfaces, Health Book aims to provide healthcare professionals with the speed and efficiency obtained from a CLI while retaining the systematic view of information through the GUI.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to find patients by personal (name, phone, email, address, tags and NRIC) and medical details (medical Information, blood type, last country of visit and allergy).*
** What it does: allows the user to filter patients by desired patient detail.
** Justification: This feature allows user to find specific types of patients (to administer drugs or quarantine patients) and expedite patient registration especially in an environment (hospital or clinics) where time is precious.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing find command. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to sort patients by certain details (name, phone, email, NRIC).*
** What it does: allows the user to sort patients by alphabetical or reversed order according to specified detail.
** Justification: This feature generates an organised sorted list by relevant detail for users to work on the targeted patients systematically.
