== Setting Up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting Up Project

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying Setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to Do Before Writing Code

==== Configuring the Coding Style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating Documentation to Match Your Fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Introduction

Health Book (or some other name that we will be deciding later) is an address book application that is catered for healthcare professionals who seek to retrieve their patients’ personal information and health-related information all in one place. Command Line Interface is utilized mainly for the input, while GUI is used mainly to display the output. By combining these 2 interfaces, Health Book aims to provide healthcare professionals with the speed and efficiency obtained from a CLI while retaining the systematic view of information through the GUI.

=== User Profile

Health Book is catered for healthcare professionals who seek to retrieve their patients’ personal information and health-related information all in one place.

=== Value Proposition

With many patients to attend to, healthcare professionals need to focus much of their attention and care on their patients and less on administrative matters. Health Book is a one-stop application for healthcare professionals to create, read, update or delete (CRUD) patient’s information, reducing the need for long and troublesome paperwork and simplifying administrative work.

Command Line Interface is utilized mainly for the input, while GUI is used mainly to display the output. By combining these 2 interfaces, Health Book also aims to provide healthcare professionals with the speed and efficiency obtained from a CLI while retaining the systematic view of information through the GUI.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven Nature of the Design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How Undo & Redo Executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data Structure to Support the Undo/Redo Commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::addinfo[]
=== Additional Information Feature
==== Current Implementation
The `addinfo` command is facilitated by the `LogicManager` which calls upon `AddressBookParser` for the execution of commands. It extends the `AddressBookParser` with the `addinfo` command.

The command takes in an `index` which represents the `Person` in the list displayed in the `PersonCardList` view. This is followed by a pre-defined list of arguments that user can input to tell the program which attribute of the person will be added/edited using the `AddInfoCommandParser` (For eg. the argument `g/` tells the command that the `Gender` attribute of the `Person` at `index` will be edited).

The command then looks for the `String` after the arguments which represents the data to be added. This data will be checked for validity using the `ParserUtil` class. If the data is valid, the respective class will be initialized (For eg. the commmand `g/M` is valid as it stands for changing the `Gender` of `Person` to `Male`. Since the data `M` is valid, the `Gender` class will be initialized). If the data is not valid however, an `ParseException` will be thrown warning users that the input data is not valid.

Upon handling all the arguments, an `addInfoPersonDescriptor` object will be created. This is essentially a facade object that contains all the attributes of the `Person` to be edited, with its updated attributes. There will then be a mapping of the `addInfoPersonDescriptor` to a new `Person` object facilitated by the method `AddInfoCommand#createEditedPerson`.

Finally, the `Model#updatePerson` "copies" attribute of the new `Person` object created above to the `Person` to be edited by calling the `VersionedAddressBook#updatePerson` which sets the new `Person` object to the `Person` to be edited using `UniquePersonList#SetPerson`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addinfo` command works at each step.

Step 1. User executes `addinfo 5 ic/S1234567Z g/M d/01-01-1970` to modify the `Nric`, `Gender`, and `DateOfBirth` attributes of the 5th person in the `PersonCardList` view.

[NOTE]
If any of the arguments contain invalid data, the program will not process any data. For instance, `addinfo 1 i/S1234567Z d/20-20-19872 g/M` will not change the `Nric` attribute of the `Person` at index 1 as the date of birth argument contains erroneous date.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` makes a call to `AddInfoCommandParser` together with the `String` input.

Step 3. The `AddInfoCommandParser` then looks out for the pre-determined set of arguments in the `String` input. If any of the arguments are found, data after the argument will be extracted.

Step 4. The `ParserUtil` class then checks for the validity of the data being extracted and parsed. If the data is valid, the class for that data will be initialized and added into an `AddInfoPersonDescriptor` object. If the data is not valid, a `ParseException` will be thrown, which will be handled by the `UIManager` requesting user the correct the data.

Step 5. A `Person` object will be retrieved from the `lastShownList` at the appropriate index. The retrieved `Person` object will then retrieve the updated information from the `AddInfoPersonDescriptor` object created previously.

Step 6. The `Person` will now have an updated additional information.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when an user executes a new command:

.Sequence Diagram for addinfo command. A full resolution of the diagram is available https://cs2113-ay1819s1-t12-2.github.io/main/images/AddInfoCommandSD.png[here].
image::AddInfoCommandSD.png[width="600"]

=== Design Considerations:
==== Aspect: Data Type for Additional Information
* **Alternative 1:** Store all data type as `String`.
** Pros: Easy to implement; easy to understand
** Cons: Hard to enforce valid data input (Can only be done with Regular Expression, which can be very tedious); `String` is not useful in getting accessory information and operations (eg. Storing Date of Birth in `String` makes calculating age and sorting by Date of Birth difficult).
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use custom data type for each additional information (enumeration, LocalDate etc).
** Pros: Easier to enforce valid data input; accessory information can be retrieved from and accessory operations can be executed on those data types.
** Cons: More difficult to implement; adds unnecessary complexity (especially with enumeration).
// end::addinfo[]

// tag::addhist[]
=== Add Medical History Features
==== Current Implementation

The `addhist` mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
The `addhist` command first takes in the index of the patient followed by the prefixes of information to be stored in the medical history.
The user input will go through `AddHistCommandParser.java` and `AddressBookParser.java` to ensure user input conforms to the expected format.
It is then returned as an AddHistCommand object for execution.
In `AddHistCommand.java`, the `execute` method will run.
The list of patients is retrieved from `model.getFilteredPersonList()` and stored under `lastShownList`.
Using the `index` specified in the command, the patient at that index will be the `personToEdit` for its medical history.
The method `model.updatePerson()` and `model.updateFilteredPersonList()` will update the contents of the patient's medical history.
Execution ends when `CommandResult(generateSuccessMessage(editedPerson))` generates a success message after medical history has been added.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` -- Obtains the entire current list of persons that is being displayed to the user
* `VersionedAddressBook#updatePerson()` -- Updates the specified person with the new data.
* `indicateAddressBookChanged()` -- Raises an event to indicate the AddressBook in the model has changed

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updatePerson()`, `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#commitAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addhist` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. If it is the first time he/she is launching it, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with a sample address book data. If he/she has launched it and has made changes before, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be launched with the data he has previously saved in his previous launch.

Step 2. The user executes `addhist 1 hsd/ 10-10-2010 hsa/Alcohol hsc/ Kuwait hsds/d` command to add an entry of medical history to the 1st person in the list that the address book is currently showing. The `addhist` command obtains the data of the person that the user is trying to change based on the index that the user has input.

Step 3. The `addhist` command will obtain the set of entries in the medical history that the person previously had, copy it to a new set of medical history entries, and add the medical history which the user wants to add into the new set.

Step 4. The `addhist` command will call `Model#updatePerson()` to update the person with this new set of medical history entries. The `addhist` command will also call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the list that is being showed to the user.

Step 5. Lastly, the `addhist` command will call `Model#commitAddressBook()` to update the addressBookStateList and currentStatePointer.


The following diagram shows how the `addhist` command works:

.Sequence Diagram for addhist command
image::AddHistSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::addhist[]

// tag::edithist[]
=== Edit Medical History Feature
==== Current Implementation

The `edithist` mechanism works almost similarly to the `addhist` mechanism.
It is also facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
The `edithist` command first takes in the index of the patient followed by the date of the entry the user is about to edit,
followed by the prefixes of information to be stored in that medical history entry chosen.
The user input will go through `EditHistCommandParser.java` and `AddressBookParser.java` to ensure user input conforms to the expected format.
It is then returned as an EditHistCommand object for execution.
In `EditHistCommand.java`, the `execute` method will run.
The list of patients is retrieved from `model.getFilteredPersonList()` and stored under `lastShownList`.
Using the `index` specified in the command, the patient at that index will be the `personToEdit` for its medical history.
The method `model.updatePerson()` and `model.updateFilteredPersonList()` will update the contents of the patient's medical history.
Execution ends when `CommandResult(generateSuccessMessage(editedPerson))` generates a success message after medical history has been added.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` -- Obtains the entire current list of persons that is being displayed to the user
* `VersionedAddressBook#updatePerson()` -- Updates the specified person with the new data.
* `indicateAddressBookChanged()` -- Raises an event to indicate the AddressBook in the model has changed

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updatePerson()`, `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#commitAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `edithist` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. If it is the first time he/she is launching it, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with a sample address book data. If he/she has launched it and has made changes before, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be launched with the data he has previously saved in his previous launch.

Step 2. The user will find a medical history entry of a person to edit.

Step 3. The user executes `edithist 1 hsod/10-10-2010 hsd/10-10-2015 hsa/Chocolate hsc/Russia hsds/a` command to edit the entry of medical history of the 1st person in the list with the date of 10-10-2010 that the address book is currently showing.
The `edithist` command obtains the data of the person that the user is trying to change based on the index that the user has input.

Step 3. The `edithist` command will obtain the set of entries in the medical history that the person previously had, copy it to a new set of medical history entries, and in the middle of that, make the necessary changes to the entry chosen.

Step 4. The `edithist` command will call `Model#updatePerson()` to update the person with this new set of medical history entries. The `edithist` command will also call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the list that is being showed to the user.

Step 5. Lastly, the `edithist` command will call `Model#commitAddressBook()` to update the addressBookStateList and currentStatePointer.

// end::edithist[]

// tag::addappt[]
=== AddAppointment Feature
==== Current Implementation

The addappt mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook` and `VersionedAddressBook`. It implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#getFilteredPersonList()` -- Obtains the entire current list of patients that is being displayed to the user
* `AddressBook#updatePerson()` -- Updates the specified person with the new data.
* `AddressBook#updateFilteredPersonList()` -- Shows a filtered list of patients.
* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Updates the specified patient with the new data.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`, `Model#updatePerson()`, `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#commitAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addappt mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. If it is the first time he/she is launching it, the `AddressBook` will be initialized with a sample address book data. If he/she has launched it and has made changes before, the `AddressBook` will be launched with the data he has previously saved in his previous launch.

Step 2. The user executes `addappt 1 s/16-09-2018 15:00 e/16-09-2018 15:30 v/Consultation Room 12 i/Diabetes Checkup d/Dr Tan` command to add an appointment to the 1st patient in the list that the address book is currently showing. The `addappt` command obtains the data of the patient that the user is trying to update by calling `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` and getting the patient's data based on the index the user has provided.

Step 3. The `addappt` command will first check if there is an invalid appointment given i.e. end date and time before start date and time, and also if there is an appointment timing clash between the appointment to be added and existing appointments for the patient. If there are such cases, a CommandException will be thrown with the appropriate message to be shown in the GUI.

Step 4. The `addappt` command will obtain the patient's existing set of appointments, copy it to a new set of appointments, and add the appointment which the user wants to add into the new set.

Step 5. The `addappt` command will call `Model#updatePerson()` to update the patient with this new set of appointments. The `addappt` command will also call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the list that is being showed to the user to show all patients. Lastly, the `addappt` command will call `Model#commitAddressBook()` to update the addressBookStateList and currentStatePointer.

The following sequence diagram captures the interactions that goes on between multiple classes during the addappt operation :

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure to store appointments
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a Treeset with a comparator function to store appointments in order of start time
** Pros: Easy to display through the information panel as appointments can be shown through a JavaFX VBox, which automatically resizes based on how many appointments the specified patient has
** Cons: The Treeset storing the appointments can be modified easily wherever it is passed, thus violating the observer pattern. Care must be taken not to modify the treeset inappropriately.
* **Alternative 2:** Use an ObservableList to store appointments
** Pros: Makes use of the observer pattern to pass an unmodifiable ObservableList to wherever it is needed, thus preventing inappropriate modification.
** Cons: Must be displayed through a JavaFX ListView, which is difficult to resize based on how many appointments the specified patient has, thus hampering user experience.

=== AddMedicalReport Feature
==== Current Implementation

The addreport mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` -- Obtains the entire current list of persons that is being displayed to the user
* `VersionedAddressBook#updatePerson()` -- Updates the specified person with the new data.
* indicateAddressBookChanged() -- Raises an event to indicate the AddressBook in the model has changed.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updatePerson()`, `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#commitAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addreport mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. If it is the first time he/she is launching it, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with a sample address book data. If he/she has launched it and has made changes before, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be launched with the data he has previously saved in his previous launch.

Step 2. The user executes `addreport 1 t/Asthma d/01-01-2018 i/Prescribed XXX medicine, next appointment on 02-02-2018` command to add a medical report to the person at index 1 in the list that the address book is currently showing. The `addreport` command obtains the data of the person that the user is trying to change based on the index that the user has input.

Step 3. The `addreport` command will obtain the set of medical reports that the person previously had, copy it to a new set of reports, and add the report which the user wants to add into the new set.

Step 4. The `addreport` command will call `Model#updatePerson()` to update the person with this new set of reports. The `addreport` command will call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the list that the user is shown.

Step 5. The `addreport` command will call `Model#commitAddressBook()` to update the addressBookStateList and currentStatePointer.

The following sequence diagram shows how the addreport operation works:

=== EditMedicalReport Feature
==== Current Implementation
The editreport mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` -- Obtains the entire current list of persons that is being displayed to the user
* `VersionedAddressBook#updatePerson()` -- Updates the specified person with the new data.
* indicateAddressBookChanged() -- Raises an event to indicate the AddressBook in the model has changed.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updatePerson()`, `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#commitAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `editreport` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. If it is the first time he/she is launching it, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with a sample address book data. If he/she has launched it and has made changes before, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be launched with the data he has previously saved in his previous launch.

Step 2. The user will find a medical report of a patient to edit.

Step 3. The user executes `editreport 1 ot/Asthma od/01-01-2018 t/Depression d/02-02-2018 i/Prescribed AAA medicine, next appointment on 03-03-2018` command to edit the existing medical report of the person at index 1 in the list titled Asthma and dated 01-01-2018. The `editreport` command obtains the data of the person that the user is trying to change based on the index that the user has input.

Step 3. The `editreport` command will obtain the set of medical reports that the person previously had, copy it to a new set of medical reports and make the necessary changes to the medical report chosen.

Step 4. The `editreport` command will call `Model#updatePerson()` to update the person with this new set of medical reports. The `editreport` command will also call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the list that is being showed to the user.

Step 5. Lastly, the `editreport` command will call `Model#commitAddressBook()` to update the addressBookStateList and currentStatePointer.
// end::editreport[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find Feature
==== Current Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `AddressBook` and filters the `internalList` of patients in `UniquePersonList`. Additionally,
it implements `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `ModelManager#getFilteredPersonList()` operations with the the 2 input parameters (prefix and keyword) before finding the patients
accordingly.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A doctor launches the application for the first time. If it hs/her first time launching the Health Book, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with a sample address book data. If he/she has launched it and has made changes before, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be launched with the data he has previously saved in his previous launch.

[IMPORTANT]
The list that the doctor will be implementing the `find` command on will be the full patient list and details stored in the database.

Step 2. The doctor executes `find hsa/ alcohol nut` command to to filter patients who are allergic to alcohol and nut recorded in the whole Health Book. The `find` command obtains the detail of the patient and keywords of the user input.

[WARNING]
If the command format is invalid, an error message will be shown to prompt the user of the correct format.

Step 3. The `find` command parser will translate the input `hsa/` into method `AllergyContainsKeywordsPredicate` which find patients with "alcohol" and "nut" predicates in their allergy.

[NOTE]
There must be more than one keyword and the prefix is case sensitive.

Step 4. The `find` command will call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to generate a patients list containing patients with "alcohol" and "nut" predicates in their allergy detail.

Step 5. The `find` command will then call `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to show the filtered list in the interface.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the activity when a user (doctor) executes a new `find` command:

.Sequence diagram for Find operation
image::FindActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::find[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Feature
==== Current Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `AddressBook` and sorts the `internalList` of patients in `UniquePersonList`. Additionally,
it implements `ModelManager#updateSortedPersonList` operation with the 2 input parameters (prefix and order) before sorting the patients
accordingly.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateSortedPersonList()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A doctor launches the application for the first time. If it hs/her first time launching the Health Book, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with a sample address book data. If he/she has launched it and has made changes before, the `VersionedAddressBook` will be launched with the data he has previously saved in his previous launch.

[IMPORTANT]
The list that the doctor will be implementing the sort command on will be the current patient list as shown in the interface.

Step 2. The doctor executes `sort n/ 2` command to generate a sorted and reversed list of patients according to their names. The `sort` command obtains the doctor's prefix and order input

[WARNING]
If the command format is invalid, an error message will be shown to prompt the user of the correct format.

Step 3. The `sort` command will call `Model#updateSortedPersonList()` to update the person list with the doctor's input of prefix and order.

Step 4. The patients list will then be sorted by `sortPersons()` in `UniquePersonList`.

Step 5. The final patient list result generated will be sorted accordingly to the doctor's input: Patient list sorted by their names in the reverse order.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the activity when a user (doctor) executes a new `sort` command:

.Sequence diagram for Sort operation
image::SortActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::sort[]


// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Data Encryption
==== Current Implementation
The encryption library used is http://santuario.apache.org/[Apache Santuario]. It extends the existing `XmlUtil` with methods that encrypt and decrypt `.xml` files.

Using AES 128-bit symmetric encryption, the encryption mechanism is facilitated by `XmlUtil`, `SecurityKey` and the file `preferences.json`.

[NOTE]
While the file `preferences.json` file is not used during the actual encryption process, the file is used to initialize the attributes of `UserPrefs` object which determines the encryption process.

Upon running the program, `MainApp#initSecretKey` checks if encryption has been enabled using value of the attribute `encryption` in `UserPrefs` object. If it is `true`, encryption is enabled and the method then checks if `key` file exist. The method will attempt to read the `key` file using `SecretKeyUtil#ReadSecretKey` and save the key into a `SecretKey` object should there be an existing `key` file.

However, if encryption is not enabled, or should there be an error reading the `key` file, or that the `key` file does not exist, `MainApp#initSecretKey` will then proceed to generate a new `SecretKey` object using `SecretKetUtil#getSecretKey`.

Next, `MainApp#initModelManager` will be executed. This method will also check if encryption has been enabled using `preferences.json` file. If encryption is enabled, it will attempt to look for `healthbook_encrypted.xml` file. If `healthbook_encrypted.xml` file exist, the same method will first load the `.xml` file using `XmlUtil#loadEncryptedXmlFile`, before attempting to decrypt the encrypted `.xml` file using the `SecretKey` object with the method `XmlUtil#decryptDocument`. A temporary `healthbook.xml` will be generated to be consumed by the program.

However, if `healthbook_encrypted.xml` does not exist, `MainApp#initModeManager` assumes that user runs the program for the first time, and proceed to load in sample data. If the `healthbook_encrypted.xml` does exist, but could not be decrypted successfully, Health Book will be launched without any patient data. An error pertaining to the failure to decrypt the `.xml` file will also be logged.

Upon exiting the program, `MainApp#stop` checks if the encryption has been enabled. If the encryption has been enabled, it will call `XmlUtil#loadDecryptedXmlFile` which loads the temporary `healthbook.xml` file before encrypting the temporary `healthbook.xml` file with `XmlUtil#encryptDocument` method. It will then proceed to destroy the temporary `healthbook.xml` file and generate a `key` file based on the `SecretKey` object and the encrypted `healthbook_encrypted.xml` file.

When users execute the `encrypt` command, the `AddressBookParser` returns `EncryptCommand` object to the `LogicManager`, which in turn executes the `EncryptCommand#execute` method. This method in turn gets the `UserPref` via `Model#getUserPref` and executes the `toggleEncryption` method, which in turn sets the `encryption` attribute in `UserPref` to either `true` or `false`, thereby enabling or disabling encryption.

The following sequence diagram shows how the encryption works when the application is launched:

.Sequence diagram for Encryption. A full resolution of the diagram is available https://cs2113-ay1819s1-t12-2.github.io/main/images/EncryptCommandSD.png[here].
image::EncryptCommandSD.png[width="600"]

Given below is an example usage scenario on how `encrypt` works at each step:

Step 1. A doctor launches the application for the the first time (by default encryption is disabled). A `SecretKey` is generated.

Step 2. The doctor added in some new patient data.

Step 3. The doctor executes `encrypt`.

Step 4. The doctor exits the program.

Step 5. Before the application fully exits, the `MainApp#stop` method asserts that encryption has been enabled. A temporary `healthbook.xml` file is generated. The same method will call `XmlUtil#loadDecryptedXmlFile` to load the temporary `healthbook.xml` before calling `XmlUtil#encryptDocument` to encrypt the file data. A `key` file is generated containing the `SecretKey` used for the encryption.

Step 6. `MainApp#stop` then deletes the temporary `healthbook.xml` file before fully exiting the application.

=== Design Considerations
==== Aspect: Loading of Saved Data
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encrypted `.xml` file will be decrypted and stored as a temporary file `healthbook.xml`, which will be used by the application during startup to load the saved patient data.
** Pros: Easy to implement - no major changes required for input/output operations.
** Cons: Users are still able to retrieve the unencrypted file when using the application.

* **Alternative 2:** Encrypted `.xml` file will be decrypted, with the decrypted data being processed by the application immediately for the loading of saved patient data.
** Pros: Unencrypted `.xml` file will never be retrievable.
** Cons: Difficult to implement given the time constraint, as it involves major restructuring of the input/output operation of the application.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of Tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving Each Component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` Component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` Component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` Component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` Component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a New Command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `healthbook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
