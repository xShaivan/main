== Introduction

Health Book is an address book application that is *catered for healthcare professionals who seek to retrieve their patients’ personal information and health-related information* all in one place. *Command Line Interface (CLI) is utilized mainly for the input*, while *Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used mainly to display the output*. By combining these 2 interfaces, Health Book aims to provide healthcare professionals with the speed and efficiency obtained from a CLI while retaining the systematic view of information through the GUI.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `healthbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Health Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds with sample data being loaded by default.
+
.User interface of Health Book
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Health Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/asthma`, `t/diabetes t/stroke` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

*Application Workflow*

1. Healthcare professionals can create new patient entries with the following mandatory details (i.e. regarded as basic information):
   a. Name
   b. Phone Number
   c. Email Address
2. The following information are optional (i.e. regarded as additional information) and is not required for the creation of patient entries. In fact, these information can only be filled in after the patient entry has been created in step 1:
   a. NRIC Number
   b. Date of Birth
   c. Height
   d. Weight
   e. Gender
   f. Occupation.
   g. Marital Status
3. Medical report/diagnosis can only be added after patient entries have been created. Additional information need not be completed to attach medical report/diagnosis to a patient. All fields in medical report are mandatory and cannot be omitted during the creation process.
4. Appointments can only be added after patient entries have been created. Additional information need not be completed to add an appointment for a patient. All fields for an appointment are mandatory and cannot be omitted during the creation process.

* Only one prefix is allowed per sort command.
* `PREFIX/` refers to certain pertinent categories of patient information and each of these categories will be defined by a corresponding prefix.
* `ORDER_INDEX` can be 1 or 2 where 1 means in alphabetical and 2 means in reverse order.
****

[NOTE]
====

====

Example:

Sort the patient list by their emails in alphabetical order (A → Z).
// end::sortcommand[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Encrypting Patient Data: `encrypt`

Toggles on and off the encryption feature for the saved data file.

Toggling on the feature will cause the saved data file to be encrypted using AES 128-bit standard. Saved file will be named as `healthbook_encrypted.xml`.

Toggling off the feature will cause the saved data file to be saved in plain-text `.xml` file. Saved file will be named as `healthbook.xml`.

Format: `encrypt`

[WARNING]
If you have toggled on encryption, it is important that you keep the `key` file secure. Losing the `key` file will cause the permanent loss of the saved data. Also, unauthorized personnel with access to the `key` file will have access to the saved data.


Example:

* `encrypt` +
Depending on the current setting of encryption, this will toggle on or off the encryption. Refer message box to understand if encryption has been toggled on or off.

.Using the encrypt command. Notice that the encryption setting is displayed in the message box after executing the command.
image::encryption.png[width="600"]
// end::dataencryption[]

== Future Enhancements in v2.0

=== Disease/Injury Tags can Have Spaces, Commas and Periods

Users would be able to include more descriptive diseases and injuries without the constraint of it being one word. +
This enhancement would be found in the `add` and `edit` command.

Example:

* `add n/Kenneth Tay p/73524475 e/TaylorSwift@example.com a/Potong Pasir, #08-25 t/Punctured Lungs t/Heart Attack` +
Adds a person with name Kenneth Tay with Punctured Lungs and Heart Attack.
* `edit 1 t/Broken Pelvis, Hairline Fracture` +
Edits person at index 1 with a hairline fracture on the Pelvis.

=== Restrict Adding Medical History After Patient Expires

After a patient expires, there would be a check in the system for future `addhist` and `edithist` commands to prevent any
medical history entries to exist after the medical history entry which contains the patient's expired discharge status.

.Current Implementation which allows medical history entries after patient's expiry
image::medhistoryV2.png[width="500"]

=== Integration of Medical Report and Medical History

For medical reports and medical history entries that share the same date, users will be able to link their medical reports to their medical history. +
In the case of multiple health checkups in a single day (e.g. X-ray, Cardiogram), multiple medical reports will be generated.
The medical history entry of the same date will allow those medical reports to be attached to it.

=== Further Checks for Clashes in Appointment Timing
`addappt` and `editappt` commands currently will only check if there are appointment timing clashes for a patient. There is currently no check for appointment timing clashes for a venue or for a doctor in charge i.e. if the same venue or same doctor is booked for multiple appointments at the same time. These features will be coming in the v2.0 release of Health Book.
