Health Book is a desktop address book application targeted at health care professionals who seek to retrieve their patients' personal details and health-related information all in one place.
The application provides both a Command Line Interface (CLI) for input of data and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for displaying of output (patient's personal details and health-related information).
The application is fully written in Java, allowing cross-platform compatibility.
